*** Shwartz's framework shows that while values may be expressed differently, the underlying motivations are universal (emphasizing shared human needs and goals)
  1. basic human needs
    - shwartz posits that all individuals have certain basic needs
    - these manifest similarly across cultures, leading to similar value systems
  2. adaptation to life challenges
    - the way people respond tend to align with shared motivations
  3. psychological functioning
    - values serve as guiding principles for behavior and decision making
    - they transcend cultural boundaries
  4. empirical evidence
    - despite how variations in how values are prioritized, the underlying motivations remainded consistent across diverse populations suggesting a shared human experience



** Human dignity

  - 1987 Philippine Constitution Article 2 section 11
    + the state recognizes the dignity of every human person and guaranteed full respect for every human right
  - ensures that every person is treated with respect, fairness, and equality
  - foundation of human rights
